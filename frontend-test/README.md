## ðŸŽ¨ Practical Task â€“ Build a UI Based on Wireframe

Use this wireframe - [Page Design](https://github.com/Gurushesh-Metapercept/Assessment/blob/main/frontend-test/wire-frame/page-design.png)

### Requirements:

- Design the UI layout to match the provided wireframe using **HTML** and **CSS** (or any CSS framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap, if preferred).

- Use a `[Data.json](https://github.com/Gurushesh-Metapercept/Assessment/blob/main/frontend-test/class.json)` file as your source of book data.


- Display the book information in **card format**. Each card should show:
  - Book title
  - Author
  - Description (optional)
  - Any other relevant details from `data.json`

- Implement reusable components for cards (and optionally, layout).

- Ensure proper styling and responsive design for mobile and desktop views.(mobile optional)

- Use a clean folder structure: separate `components/`, `assets/`, and `pages/` or `views/` if applicable.

- Include a way to fetch or import the `data.json` file and map the data to the cards.

- **BONUS**: Implement filtering or search functionality to filter books by title or author.

## âœ… Submission Guidelines:

- Submit your code as a GitHub repo or ZIP file.

- Include a `README.md` with setup instructions and a screenshot of the completed UI.
